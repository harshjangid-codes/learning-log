# Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted, object-oriented programming language developed by **Guido van Rossum** in the late 1980s.

It focuses on:
- Readability
- Simplicity
- Productivity

Python is widely used in:
- Web development
- Artificial Intelligence
- Data Science
- Automation and scripting

## Basic Program Structure

A simple Python program:

```python
def main():
    # Program code goes here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
## Comments in Python

Comments help explain code and improve readability.

### Single-line comment
```python
# This is a single-line comment
```
### Multi-line comment (Docstring)
```python
"""
This is a multi-line comment
used to describe a program.
"""
```
## Python File Rules
- Python files use the `.py` extension
- Python is case-sensitive
- Indentation is mandatory
- Python uses reserved keywords
## Basic Input and Output
Output
```python
print("Hello world!")
```
Input
```python
name = input("Enter your Name: ")
print(""Hello", name)
```
## Variables
Variables store data in memory.
```python
a = 10
b = "Hello"
print(a, b)
```
## Constants
Python does not have real constants.
By convention, constants use uppercase names.
```python
PI = 3.14159
GRAVITY = 9.8
```
## summary
- python is easy to learn
- Uses indentation insted of braces
- supports multiple programing styles
